To compile the .pleo files in this directory, you need MySkit:
Use "Motion - Save Motion As" and put the resulting .umf file on an SD-Card.
Put the SD-Card into your Pleo and use something like
"PMC|motion play a:something.umf" in PleoCommand.

PS: MySkit works under Windows and Linux (with Wine).
See installation/runtime directory for further details.
