This is just an empty skeleton, which should compile fine but doesn't do
anything when put on the Pleo.

To compile, execute "ugobe_project_tool donothing.upf rebuild"

To put onto Pleo, copy the contents of the build directory to an SD card, put
the SD card into your Pleo and execute "PMC|app load a:donothing" inside PleoCommand.

PS: the ugobe project tool works under Windows, MacOS and Linux.
See installation/development directory for further details.
